# Assignment-Format

Made this format using basic HTML5, CSS3 and JS. 
Hosted it on Netlify for free and handed all my assignments using this format rather than uploading the files on Google Classroom. It was also convenient for me to completely change the assignment even after submitting the hosted link on time on Google Classroom which saved me from submitting late or committing mistakes in the assignment.
